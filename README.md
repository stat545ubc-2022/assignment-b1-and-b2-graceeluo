Assignment-b1

This assignment demonstrates my knowledge of making a function in R, documenting it and testing it. 

This function counts the missing values (NA) of a variable in a dataset. The output is a 1 x 1 tibble with variable "col_name" and its value of the integer count of missing values (NA). 

This repository includes the .rmd and .md files for my assignment.
