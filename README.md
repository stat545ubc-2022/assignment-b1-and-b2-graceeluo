## Assignment-B1 and Assignment-B2

This respository was created for both Assignment-B1 and Assignment-B2 as part of STAT545B. A function called count.NA was made and wrapped in an R package. The goal of the count.NA function is to count the missing values (NA) in a specified column `col_name` of a given dataset `data`.

The Assignment-b1 folder contains: 
* the .rmd and .md files for the R function
* relevant comments to guide the process for the audience

The count.NA folder contains: 
* the complete R package for the function
* documents such as DESCRIPTION, LICENSE, NAMESPACE 
* folders such as R, man and tests
* installation instructions and examples in the README.md file
